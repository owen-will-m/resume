          <p>
            In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic crisis,
            state unemployment websites across the country were being inundated
            with thousands of additional unemployment claims. The Rhode Island
            Department of Labor and Trainingâ€™s (RIDLT) website was no exception.
            In partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), We reimagined their
            20-year-old unemployment system, saving it from failure. We worked
            to lower call center volume, increase the speed of benefits
            delivery, and increase overall customer satisfaction. RIDLT was
            ecstatic with our timely and high-quality designs.
